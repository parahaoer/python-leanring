问题：当在jupyter notebook报错The kernel appears to have died. It will restart automatically.或者spyder报错
Intel MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load libmkl_avx.so or libmkl_def.so.

解决方案：
conda install nomkl

报错的原因是anaconda。The latest version of numpy and scipy uses mkl by default.the default mode of Anaconda should be nomkl as soon as possible


问题：
RuntimeError: module compiled against API version 0xc but this version of numpy is 0xb
